To demo the game, click into "LauraTestLevel3", then go into "Assets" and find the folder "Scences." From there, select the file named "MainMenu." This is a scene file that opens to the main menu of the game. 

Scripts are located in multiple folders based on the programer. Most Scripts are in the folder "Scripts" within Assets. For the Cave and Castle level, the scripts are located in folders titled "Cave" and "Castle" respectivly.
